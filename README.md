# Sentiment-analysis
This is a python project that uses Sentiment analysis on news articles relating to specific stocks. This allows potential users to determine if the stock is being talked about postivley or negativley. The way stocks are talked about can be a useful indicator of how the price of that stock will move. Many Data science python libraries were also used such as numpy and pandas.
